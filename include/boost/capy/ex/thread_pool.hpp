    Use this when you need to run coroutines on multiple threads

    each task. Work items are distributed across the pool using
    a shared queue.

    @par Example
    @code
    thread_pool pool(4);  // 4 worker threads
    auto ex = pool.get_executor();
    ex.post(some_coroutine);
    // pool destructor waits for all work to complete
