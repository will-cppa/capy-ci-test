/** Base class for I/O object containers providing service management.

    An execution context represents a place where function objects are
    executed. It provides a service registry where polymorphic services
    can be stored and retrieved by type. Each service type may be stored
    at most once. Services may specify a nested `key_type` to enable
    lookup by a base class type.

    Derived classes such as `io_context` extend this to provide
    execution facilities like event loops and thread pools. Derived
    class destructors must call `shutdown()` and `destroy()` to ensure
    proper service cleanup before member destruction.

    @par Service Lifecycle
    Services are created on first use via `use_service()` or explicitly
    via `make_service()`. During destruction, `shutdown()` is called on
    each service in reverse order of creation, then `destroy()` deletes
    them. Both functions are idempotent.

    @par Thread Safety
    Service registration and lookup functions are thread-safe.
    The `shutdown()` and `destroy()` functions are not thread-safe
    and must only be called during destruction.

    @par Example
    @code
    struct file_service : execution_context::service
    {
    protected:
        void shutdown() override {}
    };

    struct posix_file_service : file_service
    {
        using key_type = file_service;

        explicit posix_file_service(execution_context&) {}
    };

    class io_context : public execution_context
    {
    public:
        ~io_context()
        {
            shutdown();
            destroy();
        }
    };

    io_context ctx;
    ctx.make_service<posix_file_service>();
    ctx.find_service<file_service>();       // returns posix_file_service*
    ctx.find_service<posix_file_service>(); // also works
    @endcode

    /** Abstract base class for services owned by an execution context.

        Services provide extensible functionality to an execution context.
        Each service type can be registered at most once. Services are
        created via `use_service()` or `make_service()` and are owned by
        the execution context for their lifetime.

        Derived classes must implement the pure virtual `shutdown()` member
        function, which is called when the owning execution context is
        being destroyed. The `shutdown()` function should release resources
        and cancel outstanding operations without blocking.

        @par Deriving from service
        @li Implement `shutdown()` to perform cleanup.
        @li Accept `execution_context&` as the first constructor parameter.
        @li Optionally define `key_type` to enable base-class lookup.

        @par Example
        @code
        struct my_service : execution_context::service
        {
            explicit my_service(execution_context&) {}

        protected:
            void shutdown() override
            {
                // Cancel pending operations, release resources
            }
