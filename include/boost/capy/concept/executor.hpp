/** Concept for executor types.

    An executor provides mechanisms for scheduling work for
    execution. A type meeting the executor requirements embodies
    a set of rules for determining how submitted function objects
    are to be executed.

    @par Required Operations

    @li `context()` - Returns a reference to the associated
        execution context.

    @li `on_work_started()` - Informs the executor that work is
        beginning. Must be paired with `on_work_finished()`.

    @li `on_work_finished()` - Informs the executor that work has
        completed. Precondition: a preceding call to
        `on_work_started()` on an equal executor.

    @li `dispatch(h)` - Execute a coroutine, potentially immediately
        if the executor determines it is safe to do so. The executor
        may block forward progress of the caller until execution
        completes.

    @li `post(h)` - Queue a coroutine for later execution. The
        executor shall not block forward progress of the caller
        pending completion.

    @li `defer(h)` - Queue a coroutine for later execution. The
        executor shall not block forward progress of the caller
        pending completion. Semantically identical to `post`, but
        conveys a preference that the coroutine is a continuation
        of the current call context. The executor may use this
        information to optimize or otherwise adjust invocation.

    @par Synchronization

    The invocation of `dispatch`, `post`, or `defer` synchronizes
    with the invocation of the coroutine.

    @par No-Throw Guarantee

    The following operations shall not exit via an exception:
    constructors, comparison operators, copy/move operations,
    swap, `context()`, `on_work_started()`, and `on_work_finished()`.

    @par Thread Safety

    The executor copy constructor, comparison operators, and other
    member functions shall not introduce data races as a result of
    concurrent calls from different threads.

    @par Executor Validity

    Let `ctx` be the execution context returned by `context()`.
    An executor becomes invalid when the first call to
    `ctx.shutdown()` returns. The effect of calling
    `on_work_started`, `on_work_finished`, `dispatch`, `post`,
    or `defer` on an invalid executor is undefined.

    @note The copy constructor, comparison operators, and `context()`
    remain valid until `ctx` is destroyed.

    @tparam E The type to check for executor conformance.
